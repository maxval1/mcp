# MCP Learning and Experimentation

This repository serves as my personal playground for learning and experimenting with the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**. As I delve into this new technology, I'll be documenting my understanding, sharing **TypeScript** code snippets, and showcasing various proof-of-concept implementations.

## What is the Model Context Protocol (MCP)?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a cutting-edge technology designed to **streamline how AI models interact with and interpret contextual data**. It aims to **enhance the accuracy and relevance of AI predictions by enriching model inputs with dynamic context, and facilitating interoperability between different AI systems by establishing a common context framework**.

You can find more detailed information and the official documentation at the [Model Context Protocol website](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction).

## Getting Started

To explore the code and examples in this repository, you'll need:

  * **Node.js** (LTS recommended)
  * **npm** or **yarn**

**How to run an example:**

Navigate to an packages directory, install its dependencies, and then run the TypeScript file.

```bash
# Run on the Root directory
npm install

# Example: Navigating to an example
cd packages/server
npm run build
npm run inspect # to inspect the context
```
